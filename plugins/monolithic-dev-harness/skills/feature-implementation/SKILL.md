# Feature implementation

Before using tracker hierarchy or artifacts, call `workflow_tracking_status`. If
tracking is paused, report that this skill is unavailable until `/resume-tracker`.

Use the generic tracker contract to fetch a feature and its user stories, confirm logical states and acceptance criteria, and publish the implementation plan as a tracker artifact. Use the SCM adapter for the feature branch and one story branch per child story.

The branch convention is selected during bootstrap and must be confirmed from integrations.json; do not invent a provider-specific naming rule. Open story pull requests against the feature branch, reconcile ancestor changes before new descendant commits, land stacked stories with `merge-story-stack-into-feature`, and hand off to finish-feature-development after all stories merge.

## Harness flow per Story

For each child Story in the stack order: `start-ticket` → `write-spec` (gate G2) → `implement-story`
(on the Story branch based on the Feature branch) → `review` (verdict, then a draft pull request
against the Feature branch). Every tracker write, push, and pull request goes through the approval
protocol in the `harness` skill.
